This is a python script named sum-columns which takes in two parameters, a csv file and an integer, and calculates the sum of the column in the csv file indicated by the integer. The script first checks for boundary conditions, to make sure that the input is valid. If the input is valid, the script reads each line of the csv file and calculates the sum of the column indicated by the integer. Finally, the script prints the total sum and the name of the column.
